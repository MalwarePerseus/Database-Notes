## Database Queries
Queries are requests made to the databse management system for specific information.

As the database's structre become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want.

Eg : A google search is a query

- A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS ( writted in SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.
		-> Generally Databases contain tons of data which often gets hidden in complex schemas, our goal is to only get the data we need, thus we use Queries.

Example :

```SQL
	SELECT employee.name, employee.age
	FROM employee
	WHERE employee.salary > 30000;
```

Example 2 :
```SQL
	SELECT student.name, student.major
	FROM student
	ORDER BY student_id DESC
	LIMIT 2;
```
