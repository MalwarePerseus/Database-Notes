### Primary Key
An attribute which uniquely defines the row in the database.

Here emp_id is the Primary Key and branch_id is Foreign key

### Foriegn Key
The primary key of another table stored in a row.
```SQL
  --Use this Constraint while creating the foriegn key field, where table is the foriegn table and field is the primary key of that table.
  
  references table.field
```

This table is connected to the one above using the branch_id foreign key.

A table can have multiple Foreign Keys.

Here super_id stands for supervisor id. This row indicated that the employ with emp_id 100 is the supervisor of employs Michael and Josh, and so on.

### Composite Keys
When two rows together to make a key.
When one single column/field is unable to uniquely indentify a record, then two or more columns/fields are joined together to form primary key known as composite key.

## Creating A Table 
The following code creates an empty table with the name ***student***.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE student;
```

A more complex table :
```SQL
	CREATE TABLE student (
		student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		name VARCHAR(20),
		major VARCHAR(20)
	);
```

or

```SQL
	CREATE TABLE student (
		student_id INT,
		name VARCHAR(20),
		major VARCHAR(20),
		PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
	);
```

- The Table created can be now viewed in detail by typing 

	```SQL
	DESCRIBE student;
	```

### Deleting a Table
A table can be deleted by running the DROP TABLE query; In the example below, the ***student*** table is being deleted :

```SQL
	DROP TABLE student;
```

### Altering a Table
- **Adding a Specific Column**
	```SQL
	ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(3,2);	
	```
This will add the column gpa to the student table, which will accept 3 digit decimal integers, with 2 digits after the decimal point (so basically only one digit before it)

- **Removing a Specific Column** 
```SQL
	ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;
```
or
```SQL
	ALTER TABLE student DROP gpa;
```

This will remove the gpa column from the student table.

### Inserting values inside a Table
Rows of values can be inserted in the table by the INSERT Query, the sequence being the same as while creating the table : 
```SQL
	INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Deepak', 'Computer Science');
```
This will insert the row in the students table :
		- ![[Pasted image 20220218015613.png]]
***All the values of a table can be displayed by the command  SELECT  *  FROM  student;*** (where student is the name of the table)

or 
```SQL
	INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(2, 'Rahul');
```
 The above command is usefull when you only want to fill in some selected columns (like in this case rahul hadn't selected his major yet, so we leave it blank and fill the other two colums with values
